This notebook uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset to build a classification model that predicts whether a tumor is **malignant** or **benign**.

## Key Features
- Data loading from sklearn
- Visualization of feature relationships
- Train-test split and feature scaling
- Model training with Logistic Regression
- Evaluation with accuracy and confusion matrix

## Goal
Practice basic machine learning techniques and prepare a portfolio-worthy notebook for GitHub.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- TensorFlow (optional)
